# Plotter

Tries to find an optimized distribution for n plots to m players, maximizing total satisfaction.

## TODOs

* download assignments and total mappings as ... csv? json? maybe both
* upload same filetype (manual override of assignments to display)
* update locked notification -> "You've been assigned Plot # xx"
